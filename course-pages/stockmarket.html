            <p id="matter">Stock marketing is the process by which companies raise money by selling shares of ownership to investors, also known as shares. The stock market is a regulated environment where investors can buy and sell shares of companies, and where companies can issue shares and other securities for trading. Investors benefit by exchanging their money for shares on the stock market, and as companies use the money to grow and expand their businesses, investors benefit as their shares become more valuable.</p><br/>
